# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
State Update: The state value is updated to the new value provided to the setter function.
Re-render: React schedules a re-render of the component to reflect the updated state.
Virtual DOM Diffing: During the re-render, React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one to determine what has changed.
DOM Updates: React updates the actual DOM to match the new virtual DOM, applying only the necessary changes.
