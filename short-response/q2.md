# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer
The useState hook in React returns an array with two elements:
Current State Value: The first element is the current state value.
State Setter Function: The second element is a function that allows you to update the state value.
```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// count is the current state value initialized to 0, and setCount is the function used to update count.
```
